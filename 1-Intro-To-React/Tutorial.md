It's quite good :)

Let's go through some tools and what they do!

*Node*
- JavaScript Runtime
- Think of it as a way to run javascript without a browser

*Npm*
- Package manager for Node / JavaScript ( / more )

*package.json*
- Project Description
- Dependencies, git repo, author etc

*ECMAScript*
- Standarded Specification for JavaScript
- Could say JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript

*Webpack*
- Bundler
- Takes all your dependencies and bundles it into a single js file to avoid making lots of server requests

*Babel*
- Transpiler
- Transpiles your new es201X code into older versions of javascript to support older browsers like Internet Explorer
- Support for non tranditional JavaScript features like annotations and JSX - we care about JSX

*JSX*
- HTML templating superset of JavaScript
- Write html alongside JavaScript!
